# wordy

## Description

üëçüèª A simple command-line wrapper for [youdao](https://github.com/longcw/youdao).

‚≠êÔ∏è Support consecutively querying multiple words, and save them to CSV file.

## Usage

### Install with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Recommended)
```shell
git clone https://github.com/gaojunran/wordy.git
cd wordy
uv install # need uv first
uv run main.py
```

### Install without uv
```shell
git clone https://github.com/gaojunran/wordy.git
cd wordy
pip install .
python main.py
```

Type in the words you want to query. Directly you can get a colorful result(Supported by [youdao](https://github.com/longcw/youdao)).

### Generate CSV file

Run `main.py` with `--csv`. It will parse the sqlite database generated by [youdao](https://github.com/longcw/youdao), and generate a CSV file.

### Generate PDF word list

Use [typst](https://typst.app/) to generate a PDF word list table based on the generated CSV. 

If you haven't installed typst, run:

```shell
brew install typst  # For macOS with Homebrew
scoop install typst  # For Windows with Scoop

# Visit https://github.com/typst/typst/releases if you don't meet either of the above requirements.
```

You need to run `main.py` with `--csv` first to generate the CSV file. Then, run `main.py` with `--pdf`. 

If you are familiar with [typst](https://typst.app/), you can customize the [template](./typst-template/main.typ) to fit your needs.

### Compatability with [youdao](https://github.com/longcw/youdao)

We also support extra options/arguments in [youdao](https://github.com/longcw/youdao), just run with these options/arguments.

```shell
uv run main.py -c   # Same as yd -c
```

### Notice

üì¢ Run in real terminal instead of PyCharm/VS Code's built-in terminal.

##  TODO

- [ ] Transform into a package which can be installed and run in terminal.
